    "overview_content2": "Shanghai was first set up as a county by then government in 1292 (Yuan Dynasty). After 700+ years of development, it has grown into the most prosperous, dynamic city in this country. In history of Shanghai, two periods have to be mentioned: in 1910's-1930's Shanghai entered its first heyday. It was the richest city in East Asia, nicknamed as 'Oriental Paris', when European style buildings were widely constructed at city downtown, which can still be seen on the Bund and the former French Concession currently. From 1990's to present, Shanghai got revived, and its economy was put back on the right track because of the lift of market restriction and opening up to the outside world. An unprecedented construction boom during the period made Pudong area a pride of Chinese people.",
